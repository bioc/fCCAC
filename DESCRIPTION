Title: functional Canonical Correlation Analysis to evaluate Covariance
        between nucleic acid sequencing datasets
Author: Pedro Madrigal <bioinformatics.engineer@gmail.com>
Description: An application of functional canonical correlation
        analysis to assess covariance of nucleic acid sequencing
        datasets such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep
        sequencing (ChIP-seq). The package can be used as well with other types
	of sequencing data such as neMeRIP-seq (see PMID: 29489750).
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0), S4Vectors, IRanges, GenomicRanges, grid
