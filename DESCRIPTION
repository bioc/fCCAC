Title: functional Canonical Correlation Analysis to evaluate Covariance
        between nucleic acid sequencing datasets
Author: Pedro Madrigal <pmadrigal@ebi.ac.uk>
Description: An application of functional Canonical Correlation
        Analysis to allow the assessment of: (i) reproducibility 
        of biological or technical replicates, analyzing their shared 
        covariance in higher order components; and (ii) the associations 
        between different datasets. 
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0), S4Vectors, IRanges, GenomicRanges, grid
